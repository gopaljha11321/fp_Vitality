Title of the Project :
Vitality - The LifeSaver Project
Description :
Covid-19 is a worldwide pandemic that needs a special attention from innovators as well as medical assistance ensuring that patient should be completely isolated, and even patients can't get doctor's assistance and medical attention completely as doctors also contain a risk of infection.

To overcome this problem we have created a IOT product named VITALITY- Low cost medical surveillance device. This product will monitor the patient's Body vitals:
1. Blood Oxygen-SPO2
2. Heart Monitoring-Electrocardiogram(ECG) & Heart Rate Monitoring
3. Body temperature
4. Room temperature and Humidity

* All these data would be securely(Encrypted) 
 transmitted via our website to the medical practitioner and Family members could see in Real time so that the doctor can prescribe the necessary medication accurately according to their analysis and no patient should Left behind.

* If the Body Vitals of the patients go out of the threshold values set by doctors our system would raise a SOS to the medical emergency team and necessary medical attention would be provided to the patient.

* Cost For the project would be incredibly less.
